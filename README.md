#bisque 0.2.0

A small JavaScript-based CSS extension that helps you to easily craft graphical interface by using CSS3 instead of images.

Stand-alone and easy to learn. There's nothing to do on the JavaScript part. Here are some [demos](http://uhear.me/bisque/).

###The advantages of CSS3 graphics:

*  CSS file is far smaller than images;
*  Easy to modify
*  Responsive

#Get Started

link your stylesheets that sargent will process and set 'rel' attribute to 'stylesheet/bisque'.

```html
  <link rel='stylesheet/bisque' type='text/css' href='yourgraphics.css'/>
```

Then include bisque.js in the <head> element of your page.

```html
  <script type='text/javascript' src='bisque.js'></script>
```

That's it!
